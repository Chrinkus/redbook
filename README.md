# Redbook

This is my project repository for working through the text _OpenGL Programming Guide 9th ed_. The official repository is found [here](https://github.com/openglredbook/examples).

The reader is directed to fork the source and experiment. I have instead decided to create a separate repository and build the environment in pieces as needed to help me better understand the build process as well as the content. I hope this does not violate the intentions of the authors.
