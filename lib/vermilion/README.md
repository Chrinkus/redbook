# Vermilion Lib

**THIS IS NOT MY WORK**

_This code has been copied from the official OpenGL Programming Guide source code [repository](https://github.com/openglredbook/examples)._

This library is a "helper library" that comes packaged with the source code for the __OpenGL Programming Guide 9th ed__ (aka the Redbook). This library will be used to bootstrap some of the earlier examples from the text until such a time as the reader will be able to work without them.

I attempted to clone and use the [gl2w](https://github.com/skaslev/gl3w) repository but the code generated there was (somehow) not compatible with the Vermilion lib files and the reasons are beyond me at this point in time.

## Reasons for Hacking

When I was unable to just compile the example on my machine by including and linking RPM packages I discovered the existence of this "helper" library. I wanted to continue to work out of my own repository so I assembled this lib piece by piece and learned a bit about compiling and linking OpenGL apps.

Hopefully I will be able to write programs without this lib soon.
